      "It really depends on which course you have in mind and where you’re trying to enroll. Different schools and programs set their own add/drop deadlines, enrollment caps, and late-registration policies. Here’s how you can find out quickly:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Identify the course and institution  \n",
      "  • Which course code or title? (e.g. “BIO-101” or “Intro to Digital Marketing”)  \n",
      "  • Which university, college or online platform is offering it?\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Check the academic calendar or enrollment system  \n",
      "  • Most schools publish an official “last day to add” or “late-registration” deadline.  \n",
      "  • If you’re on an online platform (Coursera, Udemy, edX, etc.), see the “enroll by” date in the course description.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Contact the right people  \n",
      "  a) Registrar’s or Records Office:  \n",
      "     – Can tell you if the online portal is still open for registration or late adds.  \n",
      "  b) Course instructor or department administrator:  \n",
      "     – May grant a permission number or override if the deadline has passed.  \n",
      "     – Can advise how to catch up on missed lectures/assignments.  \n",
      "  c) Academic advisor/student services:  \n",
      "     – Will explain any ramifications for your transcript, financial aid, or program plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Be prepared to catch up  \n",
      "  • If you’re allowed in after the start date, ask for  \n",
      "    – Lecture recordings or slides you’ve missed  \n",
      "    – Past assignments and deadlines  \n",
      "    – Any quizzes/tests already completed  \n",
      "  • You may need to negotiate an extended deadline or do makeup work.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Consider alternatives  \n",
      "  • If you’ve missed the official window and overrides aren’t possible, look at the next semester or term.  \n",
      "  • Some institutions offer “accelerated,” “summer,” or “self-paced” versions of the same course.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bottom line: It may not be “too late,” but you’ll have to move fast. Start by checking the official add/drop deadline in your academic calendar, then contact the registrar and the instructor right away.\n"
